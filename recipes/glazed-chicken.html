    <h3>Briefly Description:</h3>
    <p>This honey chicken recipe was given to me by a friend. I've used this recipe for years, and my family requests it
        often. It's a light meal that everyone will enjoy. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk honey, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken in hot oil until lightly brown, about 5

        <li>Pour honey mixture into the skillet; continue to cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center
